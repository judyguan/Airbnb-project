# Kaggle Project: Airbnb Price Prediction Challenge
This project was part of an in-class Kaggle competition for a course that I took at Columbia University in fall 2019.

Description:
People interested in renting an apartment or home share information about themselves and their property on Airbnb, and those who end up renting the property share their experiences through reviews. The dataset contains information on over 90 variables related to the property, host, and reviews for over 35,000 Airbnb rentals in New York.

Goal:
Develop a supervised machine learning model using the dataset supplied and use it to predict the price of a previously unseen set of Airbnb rentals(included in scoringData.csv).

Evaluation Metric:
Submissions are evaluated based on RMSE (root mean squared error). Lower the RMSE, better the model.
