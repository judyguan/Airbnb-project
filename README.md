# Kaggle Project: Airbnb Price Prediction Challenge
Description:
People interested in renting an apartment or home share information about themselves and their property on Airbnb. Those who end up renting the property share their experiences through reviews. The dataset contains information on over 90 variables related to the property, host, and reviews for over 35,000 Airbnb rentals in New York.

Goal:
Construct a model using the dataset supplied and use it to predict the price of a set
of Airbnb rentals included in scoringData.csv.

Metric:
Submissions are evaluated based on RMSE (root mean squared error). Lower the RMSE, better the model.
